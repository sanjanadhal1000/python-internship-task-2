Final Review & Submission
===========================

1. Summary of Key Learnings
   • Data cleaning: handling missing values, duplicates, outliers.
   • Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): visualizing distributions, correlations, and feature relationships.
   • Statistics: hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-square, ANOVA), confidence intervals, p-values.
   • Machine Learning:
        - Classification models: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree.
        - Regression models: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest Regressor.
        - Model evaluation: accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, MSE, RMSE, R².
   • Feature engineering: encoding, scaling, train-test split techniques.
   • Portfolio building: writing scripts, reports, plots, project structure, and GitHub-style documentation.

2. Finalizing Client / Mentor Submission
   • Verified all 5 projects:
        Project 01 – Iris Dataset  
        Project 02 – Gender vs Salary (Hypothesis Testing)  
        Project 03 – Breast Cancer Classification  
        Project 04 – California Housing Prices Regression  
        Project 05 – Titanic Survival Prediction
   • Ensured each project has:
        - Python script  
        - Dataset  
        - Report (TXT or PDF)  
        - Plots  
        - Readme summary

3. Reflection on Progress
   • Completed full 28-day data analysis & ML learning journey.
   • Built 5 solid portfolio projects.
   • Improved Python, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and statistics confidence.
   • Gained practical experience in debugging, writing maintainable code, and structuring real projects.
   • Ready to apply for Data Analyst / ML Intern roles with portfolio proof.

4. Next Steps
   • Upload to GitHub or Drive for portfolio showcase.
   • Add these projects to resume under "Technical Projects".
   • Continue improving with advanced ML, SQL practice, and real datasets.
