Title: A/B Statistical Analysis on Zomato Restaurant Ratings

1. Introduction

    The purpose of this project is to compare two groups in the Zomato dataset to see if there is a statistical difference in restaurant ratings.
    In this study, the two groups compared are:

    Restaurants with online delivery

    Restaurants without online delivery

    The goal is to check whether online delivery impacts restaurant ratings.

2. Problem Statement

    We want to test:

    “Is there a significant difference between average ratings of restaurants that offer online delivery vs those that don’t?”

3. Hypotheses

    Null Hypothesis (H₀):
        There is no difference in mean ratings between the two groups.
        μ₁ = μ₂

    Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):
        There is a difference in mean ratings between the two groups.
        μ₁ ≠ μ₂

4. Methodology

    Two-sample independent t-test (Welch’s test)

    Significance level α = 0.05

    Tools used: Python, Pandas, SciPy

Groups:

    Group A: Restaurants with online delivery

    Group B: Restaurants without online delivery

5. Results

    === T-Test Results ===
        T-statistic: 30.29
        P-value: 0.0
        Degrees of freedom: 8198.32

    === Group Means ===
        Mean Rating (Online Delivery): 3.25
        Mean Rating (No Delivery): 2.47

6. Conclusion

    If p-value < 0.05:

    We reject the null hypothesis.
    There is a statistically significant difference in restaurant ratings between restaurants offering online delivery and those that do not.
