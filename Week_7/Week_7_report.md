# Week 7 – Client Project: House Price Prediction

## Objective
To build a machine learning regression model that predicts house prices based on features such as crime rate, number of rooms, nitric oxide levels, and more.

## Dataset
Boston House Price dataset (scikit-learn).

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset and explored the features.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Applied Linear Regression.
4. Evaluated the performance using MSE and R² score.
5. Visualized actual vs predicted prices.
6. Exported predictions as CSV.

## Results
- Mean Squared Error: (your result)
- R² Score: (your result)

The model performs adequately for basic regression tasks but can be improved using advanced models like RandomForestRegressor or GradientBoostingRegressor.
